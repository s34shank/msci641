# msci641

For the classification task, each model was experimented with twice. The first one had fewer preprocessing steps and the improved model had additional preprocessing including removal of stopwords and lemmatization/stemming.
Example: bert.py includes the first type with lesser preprocessing, and bert_improved.py, bert_predictions.py (and bert_improved.csv) have additional preprocessing steps. Same for RoBERTa and DeBERTa.
